<ul>
<li>Twenty One Pilots - This was their first album they released which was released in 2009. It was all very original and different music, and I liked the songs more and more the more I listened to them.</li>
<li>Vessel - This was the second album they released in 2013. Their music was different in this album then their first, but I enjoyed it more than the first.</li>
<li>Blurryface - This is their newest, and by far their most popular album they have released. It was released in 2015, and is my favorite album they have released so far.</li>
